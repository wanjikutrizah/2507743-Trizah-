            <p>Modern web design follows principles of responsive design, ensuring websites work well on all devices from desktop computers to smartphones. Good design also considers accessibility, making sure websites can be used by people with different abilities.</p>
            <p>Web designers often use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch to create mockups and prototypes before development begins. These tools help visualize the final product and test how users will interact with it.</p>

            <p>There are two main areas of web development:</p>
            
            <h3>Frontend Development</h3>
            <p>Frontend developers work on what users see and interact with in their browsers. They use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement designs, create interactive elements, and ensure websites are responsive.</p>
            
            <h3>Backend Development</h3>
            <p>Backend developers work behind the scenes, handling data storage, server logic, and database management. They use languages like Python, PHP, Java, or Node.js to power website functionality.</p>
